# Unsupervised-Transfer-Aided-Lifelong-Regression-
Introduction:

This work proposes a novel lifelong regression framework that enables learning new tasks without target output. The proposed framework incoporates unsupervised features obtained from input data into lifelong learning by coupled dictionary learning. In experiments, we show that our method is able to accurately modeling and predict new consecutive tasks using solely unlabeled data through unsupervised transfer learning. The proposed scheme is also integrated with active task selection mechanism, which enables further improving learning efficiency when encountering massive tasks. 

How to use:

evaluation.m: main function to test the algorithm 

school.mat: school score prediction dataset (139 regression tasks)
